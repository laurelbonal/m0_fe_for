# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
i do not feel extremely confident writing my own for loops, i feel like i can tell you what a for loop othre people made are doing and why they work, but when im making them myself i feel like im just trying things to see if they work
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
i felt both productive and unproductive struggle with this. i think i was over complicating things and thats when my struggle was unproductive, but once i cleared my head and broke down the parts more, it went by much faster
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
i need to practice everything for for loops, it was very difficult for me to comprehend. I dont need to adjust my calendar because i am ahead of schedule
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
I still have lots of questions i cant even put to words. I will be in the office hours watching and listening and trying to make more sense of everything
